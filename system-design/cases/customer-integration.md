# Seamless Customer Data Integration for Völur Product

Integration with customer data is critical for the functionality of our
product. Our goal is to facilitate a smooth and secure integration process for
our customers. Your task is to conceptually design a solution that addresses
integration concerns.

## Starting point

For the purpose of this task, you may assume the following are already established:

- An interested customer who is keen on utilizing our product,
- Access to a data warehouse capable of storing the customer's data,
- Infrastructure in place for deploying resources to a Cloud Provider of your choice.

> [!NOTE]
> You are feel free to make any additional assumptions you need to complete the
> task.

> [!TIP]
> While we mostly use Azure at Völur, you are not restricted to it. Feel
> free to select any Cloud Provider that you believe would best suit the
> solution or you feel most comfortable with.

## Task

We're looking for a solution that represents the best interest of Völur and our
customers. We expect from you to

- design a conceptual architecture that outlines the solution,
- identify the necessary infrastructure components required for seamless customer integration,
- address security considerations, including data transit and authentication issues,
- ensure the solution's reliability and implementing observability measures.

Please provide an overview that highlights the following aspects of your solution:

- Advantages: What are the benefits of your design?
- Potential Pitfalls: Where could the design potentially fail or fall short?
- Risks: What risks should be taken into consideration?
- Future Plans: Outline any opportunities for future improvements or expansion.

## Deliverables

> [!TIP]
> Note that we are looking for a high-level design, not a complete
> implementation.

You may present your solution in a format of your choosing—this can be a
written document, a flow diagram, a slide presentation, or any other medium
that effectively conveys your thought process.

The priority is for you to be able to **articulate the reasoning** behind your
conceptual solution.
