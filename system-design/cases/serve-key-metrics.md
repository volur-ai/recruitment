# Serve Metrics to our Customer Engineer

Our team prioritizes the monitoring and analysis of our product's performance.
We are committed to tracking key metrics that reflect our product's health and
success. By automating these key metrics, we can allocate more resources
towards product enhancement and, in turn, provide superior value to our
customers. These insights are invaluable to our agile team for making informed
decisions and adjustments.

## Starting Point

Assume the following foundations have been laid:

- A robust set of key metrics we aim to monitor.
- An established data warehouse containing the required data to compute these metrics.
- A system for deploying resources onto a Cloud Provider.

> [!NOTE]
> You are feel free to make any additional assumptions you need to complete the
> task.

> [!TIP]
> While we mostly use Azure at Völur, you are not restricted to it. Feel
> free to select any Cloud Provider that you believe would best suit the
> solution or you feel most comfortable with.

## Task

To enable a Customer Engineer with access to these key metrics, your solution should contain

- a conceptual architecture for the proposed solution outlining how components
  interact,
- the necessary infrastructure components required to compute the metrics,
- error handling strategies, including notification mechanisms for error
occurrences,
- an observability approach to monitor and log the system's performance and
health,
- security measures and best practices.

Please provide an overview that highlights the following aspects of your
solution:

- Advantages: What are the benefits of your design?
- Potential Pitfalls: Where could the design potentially fail or fall short?
- Risks: What risks should be taken into consideration?
- Future Plans: Outline any opportunities for future improvements or expansion.

## Deliverables

> [!TIP]
> Note that we are looking for a high-level design, not a complete
> implementation.

You may present your solution in a format of your choosing—this can be a
written document, a flow diagram, a slide presentation, or any other medium
that effectively conveys your thought process.

The priority is for you to be able to **articulate the reasoning** behind your
conceptual solution.
