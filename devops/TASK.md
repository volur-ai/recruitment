Task for DevOps Engineer position:

1) Take some sample code of your own choosing for a stateless service intended to be containerized and run as an Azure function (there are a couple of sources below that you could use if you'd like to, but preferably take any custom code that allows you to quickly move over to thinking about devops). It isn't strictly necessary that your sample code is runnable code, but maybe it's nice to have something to refer to and as a starting point for a repo. We mainly use github and git for source control.
2) After you've chosen some sample code for a stateless service, write down a brief description of the part of the dev team's workflow that relates to CI/CD - only specifics affected by your choices.
3) Formulate a few sketches of scripts (richly commented upon) that would form a pipeline from development to deployment via testing. Use Microsoft-hosted agents from the pre-defined agent pool in Azure Pipelines.
4) What scripting languages did you choose and why?
5) Make a graphical account of your idea for a pipeline, incorporating components and resources.
6) Formulate (in yaml sketches and words) the Azure pipeline jobs and steps that you imagine should form a minimal, but realistic pipeline.
7) What choices did you make regarding container hosting on Azure, and why?
8) Can one use Application Insights to monitor and study telemetry of containerized (stateless) services in the form of Azure functions? If so, how? If not, how would you do it?
9) Can you sketch a plan for scaling containerized Azure functions hosted in Azure with choices of tools and libraries?
10) Do make additional suggestions if the questions are lacking in any respect, such as viable options to pre-warm services in cases when they have been scaled down to zero.

Optional sources for sample code:

Your sample code could be "mapper-as-a-service". The service could for example take a dataset as a request and as its response return a graph generated by means of the following Python library (simply use the couple of lines of quickstart code to generate the graph from data).

Your service could for example be the kepler-mapper embedded into some Python Flask web service template, for example. Here's a template that could perhaps be as a starting point for a repo.

Another repo starting point could be the following curated Scala service template.
